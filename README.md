# MarketOrderByTick Function Overview

## 1. Parameter Validation

The function validates input parameters, such as `fillVolume`, `maxTick`, and others, ensuring they fall within acceptable ranges and constraints. Any invalid parameter triggers a transaction revert.

## 2. Initialization

- Initializes structures like `MultiOrder` and `SingleOrder` for managing market order execution.
- Retrieves configuration settings including maximum recursion depth and gas requirements for failing offers.
- Sets an upper limit on total gas requirement for failing offers in Mangrove DEX:
  - Dynamically assigns the limit based on provided value or defaults to maximum allowed from global configuration to prevent gas exhaustion and ensure transaction completion.

## 3. Market Order Execution Preparation

- Sets up initial conditions for market order execution.
- Retrieves best available offer from order book to initiate execution.
- Locks order list to prevent reentrancy issues during execution.
- Enforces essential conditions related to offer list availability and security.

## 4. Event Emission

Emits `OrderStart` event signaling start of market order execution, including order key, taker address, maximum tick, fill volume and fill wants.

- `olKeyHash`: order key
- `taker`: taker address
- `maxTick`: maximum tick
- `fillVolume`: fill volume
- `fillWants`: fill wants

## 5. Recursive Execution

- Calls `internalMarketOrder`, recursively traversing order book to match and execute offers.
- Updates remaining fill volume during traversal, progressing through offers from best to worst.

## 6. Penalty Handling

- Accumulates penalties for failed offers during execution by `sendPenalty`.
- Transfers accumulated penalties to caller (`msg.sender`) after order completion.

## 7. Event Emission

Upon completion, emits `OrderComplete` event containing order key, taker address, and any fees paid during execution.

- `olKeyHash`: order key
- `taker`: taker address
- `fee`: fees paid
   
## 8. Return Values

Returns results of market order execution, including volumes traded, penalties, and fees paid.

- `takerGot`
   - This value represents the total volume or amount of assets that the taker received as a result of executing the market order.
   - It reflects the actual amount of assets obtained by the taker through the execution of buy orders or the sale of assets through sell orders.

- `takerGave`
   - This value indicates the total volume or amount of assets that the taker provided or gave away during the execution of the market order.
   - For buy orders, it represents the total amount of assets (e.g., tokens, currencies) exchanged by the taker to acquire other assets. For sell orders, it indicates the amount of assets sold by the taker.

- `bounty`
   - Bounty refers to any rewards or penalties accumulated during the execution of the market order.
   - It could include incentives provided by liquidity providers or penalties incurred for failed order executions.
   
- `feePaid`
   - Fee paid represents the total transaction fees incurred by the taker for executing the market order.
   - These fees typically include network transaction fees and any additional fees charged by the exchange platform for facilitating the trade.
